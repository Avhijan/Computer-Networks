# Computer-Networks
This repository contains a collection of network architectures and topologies designed and simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The project serves as a documentation of my hands-on experience with networking protocols, device configurations, and troubleshooting.

## Roadmap

| SN | Project Title | Key Concepts | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 01 | [Peer-to-Peer Connection](./Peer-to-Peer) | Crossover cables, Static IPv4 |Finished |

## Tools Used
* **Simulator:** Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x)
* **Documentation:** Markdown & LaTeX
* **Protocols:** ICMP, ARP (more to be added)

## Repository Structure
Each folder contains:
1. The `.pkt` source file for simulation.
2. A high-resolution `.png` of the network topology.
3. A dedicated `README.md` explaining the configuration logic and IP addressing.
